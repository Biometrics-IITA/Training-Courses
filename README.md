# Introduction
Analysis of data is a vital part of any research. To get the desired information from the collated data, an approrpiate analytical method is required. This course is aimed at equipping you with the knowledge of using R for statistical analytics.  All you need to know about data wrangling, basic analysis in R, linear regression, logistic regression, design of experiment, multivariate analysis and machine learning. The focus is on breedng analysis but the knowledge can be applied in all fields.

# Dataset
The  <a href="https://github.com/Biometrics-IITA/datasets" >dataset</a> used  for this courses are from the agricultural datasets (agridat and agricolae) in R. This is an agricultural dataset computed over time and it is readily available in R.
